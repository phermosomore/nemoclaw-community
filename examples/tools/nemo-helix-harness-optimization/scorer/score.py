"""Score a CAD reconstruction by IoU against the reference mesh.

Usage::

    python3 score.py [DocName] [reference_mesh.obj]

Output contract:

* success -> one number in ``0.0`` - ``1.0`` on stdout, exit 0
* failure -> nothing on stdout, a ``# <reason>`` line on stderr, exit 2

A failure prints no number on purpose. An earlier revision printed ``0.0`` on
both paths, which makes "could not measure" indistinguishable from a measured
zero -- and a zero is what a caller averages into an aggregate or compares to a
floor. Callers should treat a non-zero exit as void data, not as a score.

Environment:

* ``FREECAD_BIN`` -- FreeCAD executable for the headless scoring pass
  (default: the macOS app bundle, or ``freecadcmd`` / ``FreeCADCmd`` on PATH)
* ``FREECAD_RPC`` -- XML-RPC endpoint of the live FreeCAD session
  (default: ``http://127.0.0.1:9875``)

IoU is computed by per-XY-column Z-interval ray casting (see ``iou_math.py``):
exact along Z, discretized only in XY. Volume alone is not enough -- equal
volume != equal shape.

Two things forced this design:

* OCC booleans (the direct way to get IoU) silently return an EMPTY shape on
  some valid candidates -- `cut` gives back the whole candidate while `common`
  gives nothing, i.e. OCC decides two overlapping solids do not intersect.
  FreeCAD's mesh booleans hard-crash the process on the same inputs.
  Cross-checked on a candidate where booleans DO work: boolean 0.9230 vs
  ray-cast 0.9257, a 0.3% difference.
* freecad-mcp caps any GUI-thread dispatch at 90s, which mesh->solid conversion
  plus booleans routinely exceeds. So the scoring runs in a HEADLESS FreeCAD;
  over RPC we only export the candidate solid to BREP, which is cheap.
