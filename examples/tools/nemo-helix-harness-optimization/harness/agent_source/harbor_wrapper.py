"""Harbor entry point for the NeMo ``cad-agent``.

Harbor imports this class into the *host* process (``harbor-native``), which is
what makes a GUI-bound agent evaluable: the run below reaches the FreeCAD
session on this machine, while the task container only hosts the verifier.

Three jobs: run the agent, publish its trace to ``/app/traces`` where the
verifier can read it, and measure the result against the reference mesh.

This module must live in the directory named by ``agent_source`` in
the trial workspace: Harbor's ``_scoped_import_path`` resolves the default entry
point ``harbor_wrapper:WrappedAgent`` against the agent directory alone.

The agent runs from ``agent.yaml`` *in this directory*
==========================================================
Each candidate is a full copy of this directory, and the run below invokes the
agent from the copy's own ``agent.yaml``. That is what makes a candidate's
edits real: change the model, the system prompt, the MCP server set, or drop a
skill into ``workspace/skills/``, and the next trial measures it.

The change surface is ``agent.yaml`` and ``workspace/skills/`` - the two
things that survive promotion to a deployed agent. A skill belongs in
``workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`` with a pointer to ``/skills/`` in
``instructions.system.content``, which is how the deployed agent loads it too.

This file is the harness, not the agent, so it is pinned. The check below
catches an accidental edit immediately, but it cannot enforce the rule: it lives
in the file it protects, so a candidate that rewrites the wrapper removes the
check in the same edit. ``scorer/verify_candidates.py`` is the authoritative
gate, outside the candidate and never copied into one.

``agent.yaml`` must keep ``api_key_env`` and ``base_url`` under
``models.default``. The deepagents adapter's preflight requires both when the
agent is built from a config file rather than served by a deployment.
