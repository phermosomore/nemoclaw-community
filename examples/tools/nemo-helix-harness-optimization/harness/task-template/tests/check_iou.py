"""Surface the host-measured IoU as a metric the loop can gate on.

The wrapper scores the built document against its reference mesh on the host and
publishes the number as an `eval.iou` span. This reads it back out. It measures
nothing itself — it only makes ground truth visible to a container-bound verifier.
